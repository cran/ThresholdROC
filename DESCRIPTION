Description: Functions that provide point and interval estimations of optimum thresholds for continuous diagnostic tests. The methodology used is based on minimizing an overall cost function in the two- and three-state settings. We also provide functions for sample size determination and estimation of diagnostic accuracy measures. We also include graphical tools. The statistical methodology used here can be found in Perez-Jaume et al (2017) <doi:10.18637/jss.v082.i04>.
