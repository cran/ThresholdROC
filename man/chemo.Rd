\description{
This dataset contains Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) measurements (\code{SUV} variable) from 50 patients of breast cancer who underwent chemotherapy. After surgery, response to chemotherapy was evaluated using the pathology results in the surgical specimens, which was taken as gold standard by assigning one of the following three states: stable disease, partial remission and complete remission (\code{resp} variable). A column indicating the identifier of the patient is also included (\code{id} variable).
